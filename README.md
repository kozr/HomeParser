# Description:
This project extends the ability of smart homes by programming in a almost real life SMS to RaspberryPi connection. In this sample repo, a LED is coded in to activate from Raspberry Pi's GPIO04 pin once the SMS message "led on" is sent to a specific phone number, and could be turned off by texting "led off". 

# How it works:

In short: Your SMS goes to Twilio and they send a webhook to Raspberry Pi's Spark web server and Raspberry Pi then parse it and output what it's supposed to do.
